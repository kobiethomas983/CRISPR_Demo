# CRISPR_Demo
This is a CRISPR demo that uses DNA sequencing and DNA strands.
Enter a text file name "dnastrand.dat" and it will display one dna strand (several dna sequences).
In the CRISPR therapy demo you have 10 options which include 
	0) New DNAStrand
	1) Find sequence
	2) Remove sequence
	3) Add Sequence
	4) Replace sequence
	5) Find Nth sequence
	6) Remove Nth sequence
	7) Replace Nth sequence
	8) Splice sequence
	9) Quit

In the file dnastrand.dat is a data file that contains a dnastrand (you can change them if you like) but the characters should only be A,C,T, or G in the data file.
